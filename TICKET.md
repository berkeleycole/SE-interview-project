# Add candidate category filter to list page

### User story
As a partner user, I expect to be able to filter candidates by their category and see the available category options in a dropdown. 

### Acceptance Criteria:
- A dropdown select of candidate category options should be clearly visible near the page title
- Upon selecting a candidate category, the visible candidate cards should be filtered to just those who have that candidate category
- Default list view is ALL CATEGORIES
- Which list is currently selected should always display in the dropdown
- Candidate Categories dropdown options should be:
        - CUSTOMER SUCCESS
        - SALES
        - HR
        - SOFTWARE AND DATA
        - ALL CATEGORIES
